The passphrase you find turns out to be the decryption key for the scrawled gibberish on the pieces of paper, old
electronics and children’s toys you previously thought to be useless garbage.

You dutifully decode each piece in a systematic manner. The majority of the matter decoded forms a fairly self-absorbed
autobiography of a man who thought himself far more important and consequential to the world than he actually was.
You pore through pages of details about his failed acting career, his brief but disastrous turn as a science fiction
author, and his various drug-fuel hallucinations, which came eventually to centre around a certain English nursery
rhyme.

From this point on, the documents tell in complete earnest of Cartwright’s investigations into the life and writings of
Jane Taylor. Theories about her other nursery rhymes are entertained and thrown out, complex family trees are drawn for
her, fancifully connecting to everyone from Aleister Crowley to Oswald Mosley. Cartwright almost seemed to have taken
pride in collecting restraining orders from living members of the Taylor family.

The final chapters you decode – painstakingly carved into the coverings of ten diskette drives – detail the founding
of the Order of the Spark. You’re about to give up from boredom induced by exhaustive descriptions of legal proceedings
and internal politics when the flow of the writing suddenly cuts off mid-sentence… to be replaced by a dire message.

With renewed vigour, you decode the final sentences.
