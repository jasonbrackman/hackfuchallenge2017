Visually looking at the Rubik Cube layout really screamed to be printed, cut, folded, and taped together. In the
meantime the long text block looked interesting and divided nicely into three rows of 75 items.

Colour representation and coordinates came to mind. The coordinates, no matter what I did - would end
up choosing the same colour and would result in a letter clash using the printed layout.  I had a strong feeling that
to solve the encryption meant solving the cube.

I printed out the cube, but knew I would either have to write a program to act as a cube, or go out and buy
one.  I ended up finding a local drug store and bought a cube, some highlighters and white stickies.  Some arts and
craft skills, several Rubik Cube online tutorials, and some patients resulted in a solved cube.

I attempted again to match coordinates to the solved cube and had mixed results.  I was getting turned around somehow.
But I felt I saw some repetitions and knew that no matter what my center letters must be correct but the decryption
just looked like nonsensical structures.  This sidetrack had me XORing, rotating, and searching online for Rubik's cube
encryption schemes.  I thrashed around on this for a day -- and unlike the intuition to solve the cube -- these
attempts felt hallow. I was not able to progress until I finally asked myself what I wanted to see -- and I wanted to
see a phrase that started with 'hackfu'.

Sure enough the correct letters were present in the first six mappings. Also - the capitals fit perfectly as placement
for spaces. Using a pen and paper I started mapping out what would need to happen to get the letters to fit. Another
twenty or thirty minutes passed as I transferred the new mappings to a scripted decrypter. With
'HackFuThreeBlocksNorthRightAtTheDoomsayerKnockThreeTimesOnTheUglyOrangeDoor' AND finally remembering to lowercase the
line, the solution was in hand!
