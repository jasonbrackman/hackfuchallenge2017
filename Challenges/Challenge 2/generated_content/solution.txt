The solution of the Rubiks cube puzzle gave clear instructions, which you follow immediately and to the letter. You proceed to the indicated location, wait until the indicated time, and knock in the indicated way on the door before you.

A rectangular hatch near the top of the door slides upon and you see a pair of dark brown eyes on wrinkled skin. The eyes take you in with the most intense stare you’ve ever been subjected to. Then the hatch slams shut.

Your heart sinks, but then you hear a rattling of locks, and the door opens to admit you. The room beyond is shrouded in darkness.

There are many, many ways in which entering this room could be thought of as a colossally bad idea. You have no idea what’s in store for you here, having followed the directions from a weird puzzle you found at a soup kitchen after being promised by a stranger you never even saw that it would lead you somewhere where you’d never be hungry again.

But someone’s got to discover the truth. With that thought in mind, you step forward into darkness.
