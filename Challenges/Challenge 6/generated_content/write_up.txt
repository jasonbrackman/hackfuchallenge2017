Opening the new challenge in my now trusty hex editor revealed a header I had never seen before: 'elf'.

A quick google search revealed it was a Linux based file and that I was not going to have any luck opening this
executable on my PC or Mac.  I still looked through the hex codes of both files and did see something repeated in one
of the files: Phantom-Key repeated over and over.

I had a strong inclination that I would need to install Linux.  In an effort to avoid this I went down a path of
trying to research a company called Phantom-Key that is involved with a USB key logging service.  The name Phantom-Key
was repeated in the second file over and over in different odd ways.  But nothing was revealing itself of value. At
some point I decided to bite the bullet.  I installed VirtualBox and downloaded the Kali Linux distribution.

Quick sad fact: I have never used Linux before.  It took me hours to figure out to chmod +x the file and
then to start it by typing in './' before typing in the name of the executable.  I was really worried that I was biting
off more than I could manage.  The best thing though was that I downloaded the Kali Linux install -- it came with
several programs and one that would ultimately help me solve the challenge: 'edb debugger'.

I ran the program and took my time to read through the asm.  I focused on the create_decrypt_key func.  I even printed
it out and wen through it line by line.  Again the 'phantom-key' revealed itself - but this was not what I needed to
rename the secondary file too.  I printed out the asm and actually went through each line figuring out what it did. I
felt more confident in what was going on and went back to the debugger.  My confidence was a lot stronger with the tool
this time around and sure enough 'phantom_bits' was right there in the stack frame.

I immediately renamed the secondary file and reran the 'Decryptor' - SUCCESS!  But now a second problem was introduced.

Prior to really getting the 'phantom_bits' I kept circling the text that was output.  I cringed a bit on the
'Dyanetic Decryptor' title and L. Ron Hubbard's name hidden in hex.  I discussed it with my wife and explaining it away
as likely a connection to aliens, which is the theme of this years' HackFu challenges, instead of some twisty way of
introducing Scientology to all the players.  This focus became instantly important after opening the second part of
the challenge.  I needed to set the date to the 'messiah's' death, which was obviously L. Ron Hubbard. I googled the
answer and set the Linux date to the Jan 24th, 1986.  Ran the phantom_bits executable -- but it didn't work.  The
date kept switching back to current time.  I got lucky here and simply set my Mac (hosting the VirtualBox) time to
the death date and that worked.

PS: Last message I had mentioned that it would likely be my last -- but I didn't realize I had another month to
complete the challenges! :)
