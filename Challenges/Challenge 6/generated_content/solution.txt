The passphrase you find is ominous, to say the least. You quickly use it to decrypt one of the text files and start
reading.

"It’s all true. Everything I’ve been working on for twenty years. Every single one of my hunches, gut feelings and
inexplicable convictions. Jane Taylor was briefly possessed by an extraterrestrial intelligence while writing
‘The Star’. This was intended as message to us.

"Many nights I’ve dreamt of this moment, many other nights I’ve lain awake thinking of it. Finally, I’m vindicated.
Finally, every one of my sceptics and critics are proven wrong. Finally, my life’s work is complete.

"If only it weren’t so. If only I had died before this day, still chasing delusions. I would give up everything if it
meant that my detractors were correct. That ‘The Star’ was just a nursery rhyme. That we were alone in the universe.

"The Order of the Spark is not to be trusted. I have hidden this final message in precisely this manner because I
know none of the Inner Circle have the patience or technical ability to find it. Therefore, you, reader, must be a
relative outsider, perhaps a newcomer to the Order.

"Two hundred and eleven years from the release of Taylor’s fatal tome (the year 2017), on the 22nd of May, various
forces and energies shall converge to create an environment favourable for the summoning of the Great Light. On this
day, our Order is to perform the ritual which will bring the intelligence which communicated with Jane Taylor into
our world, permanently and in fully corporeal form.

"For the sake of humanity, this must not be allowed to occur. For years, I have sought the presence of the Great
Light. One week ago, I experienced it.

"I do not wish such an experience for anyone. My entire life has been a search for that which should have forever
remain undiscovered. But I have expended so many resources and expressed so much passion for this cause that it is
too late to change course now. Were I to express any of this to my followers, I would be branded a heretic and thrown
out.

“I am near death now, and my energy fades with every passing day. I know that I will not survive to prevent it my
Order’s misguided summoning. Therefore, this duty falls to you, stranger. The ritual must be stopped at all costs.”

The text file ends there. You attempt to decrypt the others on the disk, but they appear to be corrupted. This could
present a problem, you think, especially if those files contained an explanation of how the late Reinder Cartwright
actually expected you to carry out this sabotage.

Just as you’re contemplating this, something else that may present a problem bursts through the door.
