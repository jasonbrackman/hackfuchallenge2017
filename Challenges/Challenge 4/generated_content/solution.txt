As you’re transcribing the final letters of the passphrase, you hear movement at the door to your cell. You look up from your work to see the door open and a hooded figure step in. Dressed in yellow robes, this is clearly a highly ranked member of the Order of the Spark.

“We didn’t actually think you’d manage to solve it,” says the figure. “I was kind of looking forward to the torture, to be honest. But I’m nothing if not a man of my word, so rise, and live another day.”

You shakily get to your feet and hand the solution to the figure. Having no other material available, you had to write the solution on the parcel’s brown paper.

The hooded figure is silent for a moment. “Very interesting,” he says, finally. “We had our suspicions, but this confirms it. Along with the other items, this must represent…”

You’re pretty sure this guy is trailing off just before he gets to the interesting part just to irritate you. But you’re also too frightened of his earlier threats of torture to confront him about it.

“Come with me,” he says. “There are more like this, and I fear that you may be the only person capable of solving them.”

You follow, of course, without a second thought, driven by your insatiable and often dangerous curiosity.
