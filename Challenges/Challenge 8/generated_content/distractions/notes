password - 7z file

domoarigatomrroboto - qr code

- password attempts using any of the names (md5 hashed or plain text) do not open the file.

- md5 is used to hash the names of the wav and 7z file.
- 7z is 7kb indicating more than simple text file being stored.
- wav header is not normal according to the qwavheaderdump - specifically fmt length
- Left / Right channels are identical in terms of information (seems odd)
- QR code is noisy (maybe something in the noise?)
- Steghide does not work on the wav file unless header is fixed to a standard structure --
  and then this doesn't mean that steghide was used.
- this wav file appears to store its data in 16bit chunks, lsb of those chunks does not appear
  to reveal anything significant.
- 'password hellomoto' reveals some old motorola manuals, but the default backup passwords listed
  of 1234 and 000000 these and the following did not open the 7z file.
  'domoarigatomrroboto' as a pin = 3666274428667762686
  'password' as a pin = 72779673
  'hellomoto' as a pin = 435566686

# it's actually all part of an album called "Kilroy Was Here". In the future rock and roll
# is banned by a fascist government and a group called the mmm (the majority for musical
# morality) and kilroy is a rocker who gets jailed. Mr. Roboto is about him escaping prison.﻿
