escape - folder
password - 7z file
hellomoto - wav file
domoarigatomrroboto - qr code

- password attempts using any of the names (md5 hashed or plain text) do not open the file.

- md5 is used to hash the names of the wav and 7z file.
- 7z is 7kb indicating more than simple text file being stored.
- wav header is not normal according to the qwavheaderdump - specifically fmt length
- Left / Right channels are identical in terms of information (seems odd)
- QR code is noisy (maybe something in the noise?)
- Steghide does not work on the wav file unless header is fixed to a standard structure --
  and then this doesn't mean that steghide was used.
- this wav file appears to store its data in 16bit chunks, lsb of those chunks does not appear
  to reveal anything significant.
