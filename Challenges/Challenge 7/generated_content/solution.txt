As you speak the words, the void collapses around you. The white light blinks out, and you
awaken in a very dingy, very solid and very real dungeon. Your body aches from the beating you
received from the red robed cultists.

Sourceless words echo in your head. “I am weak and trapped but I will try to help you.”

As you sit up, you take notice of a faint glow on the wall opposite you. It fades quickly,
revealing a computer kiosk, complete with a keyboard, set into the stone wall.

The computer has no network connection, but it also doesn’t appear to be as locked down as a
standard kiosk. Everything from the command line to the card games are available to you. And
stuck in a USB port on one side, you notice a white USB stick.

You unplug the USB stick and look it over. The word “LATER” is written on one side. You plug
it back into the kiosk, but soon find that no USB drivers are installed, so you can’t read
its contents. Shrugging, you put the USB stick in your pocket and start a game of Minesweeper.
