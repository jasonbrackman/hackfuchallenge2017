As soon as you input the passphrase, the phone buzzes. There’s a new email, with the subject line “SECURELY STORED DATA:
THIS MESSAGE WILL SELF-DELETE IN THREE MINUTES”.

You quickly open the email and skim through its rather lengthy contents. It seems to describe a ritual of some kind,
involving a lot of incense and chanting. This ritual is to take place at noon on the 22nd of May, this year, at
co-ordinates you instantly recognise. You manage to take in the gist of it just before the email self-deletes.

Somehow it didn’t occur to you to look at the time displayed on the phone before. Today is the 22nd of May, and it’s
currently a couple of hours before noon. That explains the disappearance of the cultists.

The date of the ritual corresponds with the date given in Reinder Cartwright’s desperate posthumous message. Today is
the appointed day for the summoning of the Great Light, the possibly alien, possibly divine presence to which the Order
of the Spark dedicates itself. And in a couple of hours, they’re going to summon it.

Your path is clear. You put the phone away in the folds of your dirtied black robes and head for the exit. You’re going
back to where it all began.
