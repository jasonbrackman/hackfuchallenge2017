As you whisper the password to yourself, the music stops. The figures around you lower their arms, and those closest turn around to face you, encircling you in a ring of black robes.

In a hoarse, dry voice, the figure directly in front of you says, “When the blazing sun is gone…”

A second voice, this to your right, continues. “When he nothing shines upon…”

And a third, “Then you show your little light…”

Finally, although you’re not altogether sure why, you conclude the chant with, “Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.”

The man with the braided beard smiles. “Welcome, traveller in the dark, to the Order of the Spark.”

You bow your head reverently, carefully not dwelling on the absurdity on the situation. Not only is there a secretive cult based on a children’s nursery rhyme, but you’ve just become its newest member. Granted, you believe in some pretty crazy things, but this didn’t used to be one of them.

“We have been waiting for one like you for quite some time,” the hooded figure continues. “Now that you have finally arrived, we are on the threshold of our ultimate goal.”

“To show its little light,” says the voice from behind you.

“To never shut its eye,” says the voice to your left.

“To thank it for its tiny spark,” says the voice to your right.

Each one delivers their line with the utmost gravity, and somehow, no-one jumps out from behind one of the robed figures to reveal that this is all an elaborate practical joke filmed for a TV show. Maybe they want to keep you going for a little bit longer.
